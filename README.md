Simulation analyses and visualizations are in [`simulation`](simulation), and real-world application to RNA-Seq data are in [`RNASeq`](RNASeq).
Each folder contains TPOT exported pipelines (with FSS in `pipelines_ds` and without FSS in `pipelines_reg`) as well as the cross validated accuracy of each pipeline (in `accuracies_*`).

Questions/PRs are welcomed.
